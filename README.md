# Encryption-Decryption-Application
This repository contains a python application that is used for encryption/decryption.

This application uses a columnar transposition in order to perform its encryption. It currently has a basic GUI that asks whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt. Once the user selects one of the two, it opens a new window requesting the text for encryption/decryption and the key.

Currently, the text that can be encrypted/decrypted is limited to letters; no numbers are allowed. The key can be a mix of numbers and letters.

The decrypted results omits all spaces.
